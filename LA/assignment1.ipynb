    "Fairly often in machine learning and other disciplines that use linear algebra to formalize computational problems, you see explicit matrix inverses like A−1bA−1b in papers and books. Of course, you learn in linear algebra classes how to perform such an inverse, and in the NumPy linear algebra library you’ll see a function that will compute the inverse. It seems sensible right? And it’s right there on the page: Invert the matrix A and then multiply by the vector b. How hard can it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well… don’t do that. When you see A−1bA−1b you should read that as “the x that is the result of solving the linear system Ax=bAx=b”. You should use something like the solve function in the NumPy linear algebra package. If you have to solve multiple such systems with the same matrix, you might think about performing an LU decomposition, a topic we’ll return to in a couple of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is one of numerical stability, which boils down to the fact that 1) floating point numbers on computers don’t have infinite precision, and 2) some quantities (e.g., infinite sums or numerical integrals) require us to truncate and approximate if we want the computation to complete. These issues are deep and this course won’t delve into them significantly. However, the “explicit inverse” issue is worth looking at just to see an example.\n",
